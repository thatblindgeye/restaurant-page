# Zomb-eats

## Description
This is my submission for the Restaurant project for <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>. I decided to put a fun spin on this project, theming it after the television show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IZombie_(TV_series)">iZombie</a>, which is set in a world where zombies exist.

## Built With...
- CSS
- HTML
- JavaScript
- Webpack

## Features
The main features of this site are a focus on accessibility features, as well as using tabs for each section rather than completely separate html files.

Continuing to build on a focus for accessibility, I opted to put these features in a semi-hidden container, with only the label being visible. On hover or focus via keyboard, the container expands to reveal the various accessibility options. For this project, I included a skip link to immediately put focus on the main content of the page, as well as a theme toggle.

## Issues During Creation
1. Deciding on a layout for the accessibility container. My belief, currently, is that accessibility options should be available immediately on a website rather than tucked away in a settings menu. Deciding on a layout as well as where/how to position it on the page without sacrificing aesthetic proves to be a challenge.
