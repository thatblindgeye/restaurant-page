# Zomb-eats

## Description
This is my submission for the Restaurant project for <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>. I themed this project after The Jasmine Dragon, a tea shop founded by the character Iroh from the television show <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>.

## Features
The main features of this site are a focus on accessibility options, as well as using tabs for each section of the site rather than completely separate pages.

Continuing to build on a focus for accessibility, I opted to put these features in a semi-hidden container at the very top of the page, with only the label being visible. On hover or focus via keyboard, the container expands to reveal the various accessibility options. For this project, I included a skip link to immediately put focus on the main content of the page, as well as a theme toggle.

## Issues During Creation
1. Deciding on a layout for the accessibility container. My belief, currently, is that accessibility options should be available immediately on a website rather than tucked away in a settings menu that requires a) knowing which icon/menu to look in, and b) several presses of the tab key which can be exhausting for certain individuals. Deciding on a layout as well as where/how to position it on the page without sacrificing aesthetic proved to be a challenge.

2. Working on my ability to create a theme of colors throughout the page. I opted again to keep a more simple/minimal color scheme, which is more evident when using the dark theme, and adding in bits of color at certain points (the light theme has a more colorful header, while the dark theme you can more easily see a color change when hover/focusing on certain elements).
